# Python wrapper for Tensorflow Summary object

This package aims to leverage the visualization tool
[Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/summaries_and_tensorboard)
for monitoring iterative procedures, such as update step in machine learning
algorithm (implemented in packages other than Tensorflow, ex. Theano).
The package provides python APIs to log data as Tensorflow
[tf.Summary](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/summary) objects,
which can be visualized in `Tensorboard`.
